## Context

For the sake of this course, we are going to build a todo list management app. The user has access to a web app where they can fetch, create, edit and delete todos, which are persisted in the backend.

To standardize the [REST API definitions](APISpecification.yml), we use the [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) an adopt the design-first approach. The design-first approach advocates for designing the APIâ€™s contract first before writing any code.

The backend will be an Express.js app that will expose over a REST API the following functionalities:

* Fetch todos: [GET] /todos
* Create a todo: [POST] /todos
* Fetch a todo: [GET] /todos/{id}
* Update a todo: [POST] /todos/{id}
* Delete a todo: [DELETE] /todos/{id}

This is an over-simplification of the functionalities that a todo management app will need, but will serve to show and practices the development of APIs.
